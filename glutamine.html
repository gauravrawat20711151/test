    <h1>Glutamine</h1>
    <p>Glutamine is an alpha-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Its side chain is similar to that
        of glutamic acid, except the carboxylic acid group is replaced by an amide. It is classified as a
        charge-neutral, polar amino acid. It is non-essential and conditionally essential in humans, meaning the body
        can usually synthesize sufficient amounts of it, but in some instances of stress, the body's demand for
        glutamine increases, and glutamine must be obtained from the diet. It is encoded by the codons CAA and CAG.

        In human blood, glutamine is the most abundant free amino acid.[6]

        The dietary sources of glutamine includes especially the protein-rich foods like beef, chicken, fish, dairy
        products, eggs, vegetables like beans, beets, cabbage, spinach, carrots, parsley, vegetable juices and also in
        wheat, papaya, Brussels sprouts, celery, kale and fermented foods like miso.</p>
