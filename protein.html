    <h2> ISOLATE Protein</h2>
    <p>A whey protein isolate (often whey isolate) is a dietary supplement and food ingredient created by separating
        components from whey. Whey is milk by-product of the cheese-making process. Whey can be processed to yield whey
        protein in three forms: whey isolate, whey concentrate, or whey hydrolysate. The difference between the whey
        protein forms is the composition of the product, particularly the protein content. Whey isolates contain the
        higher percentage of pure protein and can be pure enough to be virtually lactose free, carbohydrate free, fat
        free, and cholesterol free.[citation needed]

        Whey proteins are highly bioavailable, are very quickly absorbed into the body, and have a high concentration of
        branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs)[medical citation needed] which are highly concentrated in muscle tissue, and
        are used to fuel working muscles and stimulate protein synthesis.</p>

    <h2> CONCENTRATE Protein</h2>
    <p>Whey protein concentrate is the cheapest and most common form of whey protein, a byproduct of cheese production.
        Whey protein concentrate is a common bodybuilding supplement used to increase dietary protein intake, often with
        the goal of maximizing muscle hypertrophy.

        Whey protein typically comes in three major forms: concentrate (WPC), isolate (WPI), and hydrolysate (WPH).

        Concentrates typically have a low (but still significant) level of fat and cholesterol but, in general, have
        higher levels of bioactive compounds as well as carbohydrates in the form of lactose; they are only 29% to 89%
        protein by weight.</p>

    <h2>HYDROLYZED Protein</h2>
    <p>Hydrolyzed protein is a protein that has been at least partially hydrolyzed or broken down into its component
        amino acids. While many means of achieving this exist, two of the most common methods are prolonged boiling in a
        strong acid (acid-HVP) or strong base, or using an enzyme such as pancreatic protease to simulate the naturally
        occurring hydrolytic process.</p>
